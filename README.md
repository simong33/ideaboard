# Idea Board

An Idea board app built as a Rails 5.1 API app, based on the [Rails 5 API and React.js tutorial - How to make an Idea board app](https://learnetto.com/tutorials/rails-5-api-and-react-js-tutorial-how-to-make-an-idea-board-app).

The app has API endpoints for adding, editing and deleting ideas.

Production config for Heroku was done according to this [super useful article](https://medium.com/superhighfives/a-top-shelf-web-stack-rails-5-api-activeadmin-create-react-app-de5481b7ec0b).
